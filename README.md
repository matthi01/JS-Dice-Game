Playing around - dice pig game with nice styling


GAME RULES:

- 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as they want. Each time, the score gets added to the ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, the entire ROUND score gets reset. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach a player determined amount of points on GLOBAL score wins the game
